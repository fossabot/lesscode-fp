# Overview
Based on my earlier work on [Functional Thinking](https://github.com/van001/lesscode), I propose the the following [functions](https://github.com/van001/lesscode-fp/blob/master/src/index.js). I will be using these functions and the FP principles to build other/ future projects. So stay tuned...

# Features
- Fewer category/ data structures - string, list n map.
- Built using point free style n currying.
- Provides composable function for both pure (no side effect) and monads (side effect).
- Functions to manipulate a given category.
- Functions to transform one category to another.

# Examples
